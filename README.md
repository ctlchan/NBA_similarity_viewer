# NBA_similarity_viewer
Python program to view "similar" NBA players

This program uses a graph data structure to store NBA player data, connecting "similar" players together. Uses tkinter to create a GUI for the user to search players and get their stats, as well as players deemed "similar" to the searched player.

Note: need to unzip data files - data files correspond to the 2020-2021 NBA season.
